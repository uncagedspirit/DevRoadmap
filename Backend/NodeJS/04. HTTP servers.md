- To Initialize a `package.json` in the project, run `npm init` in the terminal.
- `npm init` will create a `package.json` file which has the basic scripts and basic configurations required for the project.
- Create a main file named `index.js`.
<br/> Note : It is a good practice to always name your entry point file as `index.js`.

### Creating an HTTP server

- We have a built in module in NodeJS called as `http`.
- For that, we need to require that module in our project:
  ```js
  const http = require("http");
  ```
- Then, create an http server:
  ```js
  const myServer = http.createServer();
  ```
- We need to have a function to process our incoming requests to the server
  ```js
  const myServer = http.createServer((req, res) => {});
  //this callback function is responsible for processing the incoming requests to the server
  //the first argument, req has all the information about the request and its sender
  //the second argument, res is used to send the response.

  //example:
  const myServer = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    console.log("New request received");
    res.end("Hello from server");  //ends the response by sending this response
  });

  myServer.listen(8000, () => console.log("Server Started!"));
  ```
- In package.json, in the scripts, add the script:
  ```json
  "scripts":{
    "start": "node index"
    ...other scripts
  },
  ```

  #### A simple program for practice:
  - Make a `.txt` file and log the requests sent from the browser into that file to log the requests.

  ```js
  const http = require("http");
  const fs = require("fs");

  const myServer = http.createServer((req, res) =>{
    const log = `${Date.now()}: ${req.url} New req received\n`;
    fs.appendFile("log.txt", log, (err, data) =>{
      res.end("Hello from server again");
    });
  });

  myServer.listen(8000, ()=> console.log("Server started"));
  ```
  ##### Note that two requests are printed due to browser sending 2 requests including one for favicon again each time.

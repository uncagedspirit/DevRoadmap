## How NodeJS works

- Whenever a client sends request to the server (which is made in NodeJS for the context here), the request first is sent in the event queue, where all tasks are lined up
- The even loop continuously checks for tasks in the event queue and one by one picks them up for processing.
- The operations in the event queue can be of two types as event loop differentiates them
  1. Blocking operations (synchronous operations)
  2. Non-blocking operations (asynchronous operations)
- The non-blocking operations are processed soon and a respose is sent to the client
- When the request is a blocking operation, the event loop sends it to a thread pool
- The task is then assigned to a free thread and the work is done by the thread
- The result is then returned after it has been finished by the thread

## Blocking and Non-blocking requests

```js
//sync... blocking
fs.writeFileSync("./test.txt", "hello world");

//async... non-blocking
fs.writeFile("./test.txt", "hello world async", (err) => {})
```

- Code
  ```js
  const fs= require("fs");

  
  //blocking
  console.log(1);
  const result = fs.readFileSync("contacts.txt", "utf-8");
  console.log(result);
  console.log(2);
  //output: 1 result 2

  //non-blocking
  console.log(1);
  const result = fs.readFile("contacts.txt", "utf-8", (err, result)=>{
    console.log(result);
  });
  console.log(2);
  ```

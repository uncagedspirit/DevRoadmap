## File handling in Node.js

- To enable file handling in Node.js, you need to import the `fs` built in module from the Node.js.
- The `fs` module enables interacting with the file system in a way modeled on standard POSIX functions.

 ### Using `fs` module for file handling

#### Writing data to a file
 ```js
const fs = require("fs");

//synchronous

fs.writeFileSync("./test.txt", "Hello World");
//...Syntax: fs.writeFileSync("./fileLocation/.../fileName.extension", "text to be written")

//asynchronous

//we also get a callback function here in case of any error
fs.writeFile("./test.txt", "Hello world", (err)+>{});
//...Syntax: fs.writeFileSync("./fileLocation/.../fileName.extension", "text to be written", callback function)
```
#### Reading data from a file
- An example for understanding difference between asynchronous and synchronous functions using read functions

```js
const fs = require("fs");

//synchronous
const result = fs.readFileSync("./contacts.txt", "utf-8");   //utf-8 is an encoding type since the file can be in any format
console.log(result); //result will be printed on the console as soon as the code is executed

//asynchronous
const result = fs.readFile(./contacts.txt", "utf-8");
console.log(result);
//will give error: 'ERR_INVALID_CALLBACK'

//because of the error, there is another way we can write the same function:
fs.readFile("./contacts.txt", "utf-8", (err, result) =>{
  if(err){
    console.log("Error", err);
  }else{
    console.log(result);
  }
});
```
#### Appending data to the file without overwriting in the file
```js
const fs = require("fs");

//synchronous
fs.appendFileSync = ("test.txt", `${Date.now()} Hey there\n`);  // ... `\n` writes the input in new line
```

#### Other important methods

```js
fs.cpSync("./test.txt", "./copy.txt");
//copies contents from first file to the second (if second file does not exist, it will create it)

fs.unlinkSync("./copy.txt");
//deletes the file

const data = fs.statSync("./test.txt"));
console.log(data);
//returns data related to the file, such as when it was created and modified and some more fields

fs.mkdirSync('my-docs');
//creates one folder named 'my-docs' in the current directory

fs.mkdirSync("my-docss/a/b", {recursive: true});
//creates multiple files inside the previous recursively
```

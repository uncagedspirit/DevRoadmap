### What are modules/ packages?

Modules in Node.js are reusable blocks of code that encapsulate related functions, objects, or variables. They help organize and manage large codebases efficiently.

#### Types of modules
1. Built in modules - provided by Node.js (eg, `fs`, `http`, `path`, `os`)
2. Local modules - custom modules which can be created. (eg. ./utils.js)
3. Third party modules - Installed via np (eg, `express`)

#### How to use custom modules

> Exporting (module)
```js
// math.js

module.exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;
//we need to export that module first

//if we need to export multiple modules,
module.exports = {
  add,
  sub
}

//we can also export the function in other way:
module.exports = {
  addFunction : add,
  subtractFunction : sub
}

//also the exports.methodName way:
exports.method1 = (a,b) => a+b;
exports.method2 = (a,b) => a-b;
//these are exported as annonymous functions
```

> Importing (require)
```js
const math = require('./math');
console.log(math.add(2, 3));   
// 5
```

#### Using built in packages
- There are many built in packages in `Node.js`, such as `fs`, `http` and more similar modules.
- We can use these built in modules by including them as the module names:
  `const fileSystem = require("fs");`
- If we mention the package names as they are (eg, require("fs") ), it will search for them in the Node's directory, but if we include them appending `./` (eg, require("./math") ), it will search for them in current directory.

##### Purpose of modules:
- Code reusability
- Separation of concerns
- Better project structure

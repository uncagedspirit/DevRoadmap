# History of JavaScript

1. In 1995, a popular web browser netscape navigator felt the urge to have a programming language which could add interactivity in the websites.
2. So, a person working for Netscape Navigator, Brendan Eich creates JS in just 10 days.
3. He named the language first to Mocha, then to LiveScript, but it was not so popular.
4. That time, Java was really popular language, so Netscape Navigator named LiveScript to JavaScript.
5. Internet explorer, a popular web browser then, i 1996 felt that Netscape Navigator is becoming famous because of JS and they should do something like this too.
6. So, Internet explorer picked JavaScript, implemented some if its features and some additional features and named it to JScript.
7. Due to this, web developers had to develop the same website for two web browsers and specify which browser the site works best in.
8. So, ECMA standardized JavaScript and made JavaScript- EcmaScript a standardized languages with predefined functionalities for web browsers to work in a specified way.
9. In 1997, ECMA launched ES1 (EcmaScript 1), its first specification, and similarly launched ES2, ES3 and ES4.
10. In ES5 launched in 2009, there were a lot of new features introduced in JavaScript. It became really popular because of this back then.
11. After ES5, the biggest update by ES was launched in 2015, which was ES6 and it was the biggest update of JS in the history of JS ever.
12. JavaScript is backward compatible - which means I can still use features from first release of JS version,
13. But it is not forward compatible - which means I cannot use today's JS on old browsers, so transpiler tools like babel are used for these purposes.

## Linking JS to HTML

There are usually two ways of linking JS and HTML:

1. In the <head> tag of HTML document:
   
   Can add <script> </script> tag to link an external JS file to HTML doc.
   ```html
    ...HTML doc
   <head>
      <script src= "filename.js" defer> </script>
   </head>
    ...HTML doc

   <!-- Without defer: the browser stops parsing HTML,
   loads and executes the JS immediately, which may cause errors
   if the script tries to access DOM elements that aren't loaded yet. -->

   ```
   
2. Before the ending of the < body> tag:

   ```html
   ... HTML doc
   <body>
   ...content

    <script src="script.js"></script>
   </body>

   <!-- This doesn't need defer as all HTML is already parsed -->
   ```

### Hello world program

```js
console.log("Hello world");

//can also use '' or ``(backticks) instead of "".
```

### Comments

Comments are part of code that we don't want to be executed, they are just for understanding of code.
Comments in JS are written as:
```
//this is a comment
```

## Variables

- Variables can store some information
- We can use the stored information through the variables later
- We can also change the stored information

### var

  1. Declaring a variable using var
     ```js
     var firstName = "saakshi";
     ```
 
  2. Using a variable
     ```js
     console.log("firstName");
     ```
 
  3. Changing value of a variable
     ```js
     firstName = "saakshi k";
     ```

     - Variable names are case sensitive
     - We can also declare variables in JS without ddeclaring it first with the keyword 'var'
     - Undeclared variables can cause problems so, including "use strict"; on top of a JS code won't allow undeclared var.
     - Rules for naming a variable:
       1. cannot start wth a number: 1value (invalid), value1 (valid)
       2. you can use only underscore (_) or dollar ($) symbol, not any other symbols.
       3. Starting variable names with _ or $ is valid
       4. cannout usse space in variable names
       5. use conventions- usually camelCase (start with small letter)


### ```let``` keyword

Declaring a variable with let keyword
- (let is preferred more than var to declare a variable)

```js
let firstName = "saakshi";
console.log("saakshi");
```

- we can redeclare a variable declared using the keyword ```var```, but if we use ```let```, it will give syntax error.


### ```const``` keyword

Declaring a const:
```js
const pi= 3.14;
pi= 3.15;  //error: Assignment to constant variable
console.log(pi);
```

## Strings

### String indexing

```js
let firstName = "saakshi";

// s a a k s h i
// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

- Printing a char at an index
  ```js
  let ch = firstName[3];
  ```

- Length of string
  ```js
  let len = firstName.length;
   //spaces in the string will be included here.
  //last index of a string:
  console.log(firstName[firstName.length - 1]);
  ```

- Triming the spaces
  ```js
  let firstName = "   Saakshi   ";
  firstName.trim();  //does not update original string, returns new string
  newString = firstName.trim();
  console.log(newString);  // Saakshi
  ```

- To upper case
   ```js
   let firstName= "saakshi";
   firstName.toUpperCase();
   
   //converts all the characters to upper case
   //does not modify original string, returns new string instead
   ```

- To lower case
 ```js
 let firstName = "Saakshi";
 firstName.toLowerCase();

 //converts all characters to lower case
 //does not modify the original string, returns a new string
 ```

- Slicing methods
 ```js
 let str = "Hello world"
 let newStr = slice(0, 5);
 //slice(i, j) will return a new string from i to j-1 th index. 
 ```

### Typeof and data conversion

- The typeof operator returns data type of the argument passed.
  ```js
  let age = 22;
  typeof(age); // or typeof age; will return the type of variable age as a Number.
  //Similarly for different data types it will return different values.
  ```

#### Convert number to string

```js
//method 1

//we can convert a number data type to string by adding an empty string to the end of the Number.
let age = 22;
age = age+ "";
console.log(typeof age); //will print as string.

//method 2

let age = 18;
age = String(age);
console.log(typeof age); //string
```
    
#### Convert string to number

```js
//method 1

let myStr = "34";
myStr = +myStr;  //or myStr = +"34"
console.log(typeof myStr);

//method 2

let age = "18";
age = Number(age);
console.log(typeof age);  //number
```
